     <p>Computer legislation acts are designed to protect the <a id="linki" title="Navigate to Rights" href="#rights">rights</a> of <a id="linki" title="Navigate to Data Subject" href="#datasub"> data subjects</a> by providing legal barriers that limit data usage, selling and storage. Legislation used in the UK includes:</p>

<h3>Data Controller</h3>
<p>Data controllers are individuals or organisations that hold the data of data subjects. They determine what to do with your data; how to collect, use and manage it.</p>
<h3 id="datasub">Data Subject</h3>
<p>The data subject is any individual who has their personal data collected, used and managed. Their specific <a id="linki" title="Navigate to Rights" href="#rights">rights</a> are mentioned above.</p>

    <h2>What is the Computer Misuse Act of 1990?</h2>
    <p>The Computer Misuse Act (CMA) was needed as technology developed and protected against digital theft and hacking. These are the specific actions that it made illegal:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accessing a computer system without authorisation</li>
            <li>Accessing digital information unauthorised with the intent of committing another crime</li>
            <li>Modifying data without authorisation</li>
            <li>Developing, supplying or obtaining tools used to commit the above offences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These laws protect users from hackers, malware, viruses, fraudsters, blackmailers and people who are seeking revenge on their former place of work. It sadly does not stop these actions from occuring but the penalties are high.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Unauthorised access - up to £50,00 fine and up to 6 months in prison</li>
            <li>Unauthorised access with intent to commit further crime - unlimited fine and up to 5 years in prison</li>
            <li>Unauthorised data modification - unlimited fine and up to 5 years in prison</li>
            <li>Developing, supplying or obtaining tools to commit computer misuse offences - unlimited fine and 10 years in prison</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>What is the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988?</h2>
    <p>This act protects intellectual property (IP) - things you invent, create or design - from copycats using them for unauthorised commercial use. This means that people cannot steal or copy things such as brand names and logos, recipes, product desings and more that are under these protections. There are several ways in which this is done. The act contains the laws on:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Copyright</li>
        <li>Patents</li>
        <li>Licenses</li>
        <li>Trademarks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Copyright gives the owner of an IP the exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute and display their work. Copyright protection lasts for the IP owner's lifetime, with an additional 70 years on top. The copyright symbol looks like this: © </p>
            <figure>
    <img id="Steamboat Willie" src="Steamboat Willie.webp" alt="Steamboat Willie (the first verison of Mickey Mouse)">
    <figcaption>Steamboat Willie, a 1928 cartoon animation directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks final became part of the public domain in 2024. (Its copyright was extended various times as it is under the juristiction of American law rather than UK law.)</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Patents protect inventions, processes or technical improvements. The IP owner is given the right to produce, use, sell or license their creation. Patents generally last for 20 years except in special cases. </p>
    <p>Licenses are granted by the owner of an IP to another person to allow them to use said IP, usually under specific terms and conditions. License terms can vary and be set for different lengths of time.</p>
    <p>Trademarks protect symbols, words or logo (brand identity). Trademarks can last indefinitely as long as they are in use and are renewed. The trademark symbol looks like this: ™</p>

    <h2>What is the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act of 2000?</h2>
    <p>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act gives certain bodies, such as government security services, police, the fraud office, the office of fair trading and the environmental protection agency the right to monitor activity on the internet. These agencies can then scan for things linking to things such as terrorism, fraud, slavery, murders, environmental damage and many other serious matters. These are the 6 parts of the act:</p>
    <img id="ripa" src="RIPA.jpeg" alt="Surveillance team looking at multiple different screens">
    <ol>
        <li>Internet Security Providers (ISPs) must provide access to customer communications</li>
        <li>Interception activities cannot be revealed in court</li>
        <li>Mass surveillance of communications is permitted</li>
        <li>Monitoring an individual's internet activities is permitted</li>
        <li>Access is given to protected information</li>
        <li>ISPs must install equipment that allow surveillance to be done</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Many of these point show that businesses and ISPs are required to provide any digital communications and activity when asked, as well as have a way to store that data.</p>
    <p>Some people are worried about the ethics of the act because of how invasive it is and because of what could happen if it came into the wrong hands. Some also feel that mass surveillance could lead to a loss of freedom of speech and widespread censorship.</p>
